Hello User,
Welcome to the Deep Learning. I am putting my best effort to contribute some great deep learning projects so that we can learn and grow together. Here are few projects you might find useful.

## 1. ANN in Sports

**Problem Statement :** You have just been hired as an AI expert by the French Football Corporation. They would like you to recommend positions where France's goal keeper should kick the ball so that the French team's players can then hit it with their head.

## 2. ANN on Fashion MNIST

**Problem Statement :** Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.We need to predict among 10 classes for given image.
